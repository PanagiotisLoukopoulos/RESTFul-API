# RESTful-API
A RESTful API from scratch

# About project
The five main resource methods that are associated with our RESTful API are:
1. GET: This method allows for the server to find the data you requested and sends it back to you.
2. PUT: If you perform the ‘PUT’ request, then the server will update an entry in the database.
3. POST: This method permits the server to create a new entry in the database.
4. PATCH: Performs a partial update of a resource. The request body specifies the set of changes to apply to the resource.
5. DELETE: This method allows the server to delete an entry in the database.
